# meteogrid
##R package for geographical grids (mainly meteorology)
meteogrid`(which used to be called geogrid until 2018) is a toolbox for gridded data, mainly focussed on meteorological (model) data. It offers tools for visualisation, interpolation etc. It does not contain routines for decoding of binary data formats. Therefore, meteogrid will typically be used together with `Rgrib2` (package for GRIB decoding, available under GPLv3) or possibly `Rfa` (internal to the ALADIN & HIRLAM consortia).


##Installation
The installation requires that you first install the PROJ4 library for map projections. This may be obtained from http://proj4.org
