geogrid
=======

INSTALLATION
------------

The installation requires that you first install the PROJ4 library for
the map projections. This can be obtained from 
http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/


The installation location of PROJ must be given in the environment variable
PROJDIR, unless both the libraries and include files are already in
default locations( e.g./usr). The installation is simply
R CMD INSTALL geogrid_2.X.x.tar.gz
or
MAKEFLAGS='PROJDIR=$(HOME)/PROJ ' R CMD INSTALL geogrid_2.4.tar.gz

If your PROJ4 installation is non-standard, you may have to adapt
src/Makevars or override some other settings manually.
